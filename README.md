## Overview

### The challenge

Develop a website for a local business. This business can be real or fictional,
but must serve the members of your community. The website should include
the following elements:

- Header with logo
- Favicon
- Call to action button
- Form to subscribe to receive announcements
- Navigation menu
- Footer to include credits to website creators and copyright information

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first development
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was the first project that I built with a dark mode toggle. In order to do that I had to build the CSS with colors from CSS variables, instead of hard coding the colors. I learned a lot more about CSS from this because I followed a blog about the dark mode toggle (see below), but changed the design of the toggle.

### Useful resources

- [Dark Mode Blog Post](https://dev.to/ananyaneogi/create-a-dark-light-mode-switch-with-css-variables-34l8) - This helped me learn about making a dark mode toggle. I will continue using this strategy.
